# Changelog

## 2.4.1 — 2026-07-31

- Added an install-time diagnostic that warns when npm's global executable directory is missing from `PATH` and prints the exact shell command to fix it.
- Added README troubleshooting for successful global installs where `venice-video` is not found.

## 2.4.0 — 2026-07-31

First standalone CLI release.

### Added

- Global `venice-video` command that runs without Cursor, Claude Code, OpenCode, MCP, or another agent host.
- `venice-video setup` for validated API-key and workspace configuration.
- `venice-video doctor` plus configuration inspection and cleanup commands.
- Film-first `venice-video new` wizard. Film projects may be any length.
- Explicit project workspaces instead of relying on the current directory.
- Resumable episode production with a standalone vision-QA approval gate.
- Importable TypeScript package surface for the Venice client, model registry, video generation, and series management.
- Packed-artifact tests covering setup, key masking, private file permissions, and Film creation.

### Changed

- Video retrieval now uses the configured Venice client instead of reading the environment directly.
- Sharp updated to 0.35.3 to resolve inherited 2026 libvips vulnerabilities.
- npm artifacts are restricted to compiled output, documentation, and the license.

### Compatibility

- Existing `video-harness` and `storyboard` executable aliases remain available.
- Repository `.env` and `VENICE_API_KEY` workflows remain supported.
- Agent orchestration files remain in the repository but are not included in the npm package.
